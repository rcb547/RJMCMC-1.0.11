This example constructs a synthetic dataset consisting of a series of
3D points on the surface on a sphere with a known centre and
radius. Some noise is added to the location of these points and the
simulation attempts to determine the actual centre and radius of the
known sphere. The program outputs the real and guessed x, y, z
coordinates and radius on completion.

Instructions:

> make
> ./spherefit
> python plot_misfit.py
> python plot_x.py
> python plot_y.py
> python plot_z.py
> python plot_r.py
