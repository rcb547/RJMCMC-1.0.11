This example does a MCMC solution to fit a 2D Gaussian with
centred at 0,0 with a standard deviation of 1 (in x and y).

Note that this example was used to generate an animation and
as such it outputs GEO files that can be used by the Houdini
3D Animation package.

Instructions:

> make
> ./gaussian
