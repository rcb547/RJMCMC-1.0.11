This forward model example is a simple fitting of a synthetic function
with multitple discontinuities with added noise. It is almost exactly
the same as the other function fit example except that it uses the 
Fortran interface.

Instructions:

> make
> ./functionfitf
> python plot_misfit.py
> python plot_mean.py 
> python plot_partition_count_histogram.py
> python plot_partition_x_hist.py
